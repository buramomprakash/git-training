    <h4>The eternal flame at a war memorial in the Indian capital, Delhi, has been put out and merged with a newer flame
    </h4>
    <div>
        <p1>The Amar Jawan Jyoti, which has been burning for more than five decades to honour the martyrs of the armed
            forces, was merged on Friday with a newer flame located less than 400m away in the newly built National War
            Memorial.</p1>
    </div></br>
    <div>
        <p1>Both are located in the India Gate complex, which was inaugurated in 1931 in memory of Indian soldiers who
            died
            fighting for the British Raj.</p1>
    </div></br>
    <div>
        <p1>The Amar Jawan Jyoti inspired generations of Indians and became an iconic image. Television coverage of
            India's
            Republic Day parades always started with visuals of the flame.</p1>
        <div></br>
            <div>
                <p1>The flame at the National War Memorial, which was inaugurated in 2019, would now serve as a memorial
                    for all
                    martyrs of the armed forces. It has names of the soldiers who died in wars and conflicts after India
                    became
                    independent in 1947.</p1>
            </div></br>
            <div>
                <p1>Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia, who spent many years in Delhi in senior military roles, recounts
                    his memories
                    of the Amar Jawan Jyoti and what it meant to him and millions of Indians. His account is accompanied
                    by pictures
                    by Aditya Kapoor, who was given exclusive access in 2009 to photograph the iconic India Gate
                    complex.</p1>
            </div></br>

            <p1>When the Amar Jawan Jyoti was established, I was studying at the National Defence Academy to become an
                officer.
                So, I didn't know much about it at the time. But after getting commissioned, I came to Delhi and then I
                went to
                see the flame in October 1974.

            </div>
            <h3>Names of the soldiers who died fighting for the British are inscribed on the iconic India Gate</h3>
            
            <div>
                <p1>I was just 20 years old at the time and it was a personal moment for me when I paid my respect to the
                1971 martyrs. I knew some of the martyrs who were my seniors from the military academy.</p1>
                </div><br>
              <div>

                <p1>Since then, every time I'd been to India Gate - and we used to live very close to it as a family - my
                children and I would stand there and we'd observe one minute of silence to pay our respects to the
                soldiers. Others who saw us doing it would do the same thing.</p1>
                </div><br>
                <div>
                <p1>  I  used to go there almost daily when I lived in Delhi. Going there gave me a sense of connection with
                the soldiers. I would say goosebumps is the right word to describe my feeling. I felt pride in the fact
                that they had sacrificed everything for their nation.</p1>
                </div><br>
                <div>
                <p1> I think my children also felt inspired and that is why they also joined the armed forces. I used to tell
                them stories of the fallen soldiers.</p1>
                </div></br>

                It's very traumatic losing a colleague. It's never easy. When you lose a soldier, you think for days on
                end if there was anything you could have done to save his life. That's a question that keeps haunting
                you over and over again. So, when you stand in front of the flame, you remember all of them.</p1>
                </div></br>
                <div>
                <p1>It's not about a particular soldier who served with you, it's more about respecting [them all]. The
                armed forces are all about respecting, it's all about respect and regard, nothing else. That is what we
                did in front of the flame.</p1>
                </div></br>
                <div>
                <p1>But the decision to move the flame to the National War Memorial was needed. It's an excellent decision
                because the National War Memorial [unlike India Gate] commemorates the soldiers who fought for India
                after the country became independent in 1947.</p1>
                </div></br>

                More than 25,000 soldiers have died in wars and conflicts since then. We pay homage to them but also
                honour the serving soldiers and the veterans out there.
